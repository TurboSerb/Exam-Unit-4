Step 1. 

created folder and made a git repo. Added basic html 5 scaffoldd

Step 2

created a class called game, which we exported from game.mjs and imported into app.mjs. there is the information based on the example.JSON. title, designer, players, ect.

Step 3.
Created four functions, one to save the game to local storage, create a function that retrieves all games saved in local storage, a function that outputs all games as JSON and a function that imports the mentioned JSON.

Step 4.

created a input element and gave it the ability to save it to local storage. created another function to give all of the game entries and put them into the class object.

Step 5.

made visuals for the live server visualizing, title, designer, artist, publisher, year, players, time and difficulty. displaying the different information from the JSON file.

Step 6.

i made it so that on the live server there is some order to it, i added a sliding bar for the rating and a adjustable button for the player count. i also had to go back and change my code becuase it wouldnt show up on the live server.
